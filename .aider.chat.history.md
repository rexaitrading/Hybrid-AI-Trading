#### Please add missing tests to cover all uncovered lines in smart_router.py and push coverage to 100%.  

To achieve 100% test coverage for `smart_router.py`, we need to add tests for the following scenarios:

1. Test the `choose_route` method for symbols that do not match any specific broker conditions.
2. Test the `_timeout_wrapper` method for a successful execution without exceptions.
3. Test the `route_order` method for scenarios where all brokers fail due to exceptions.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to add these tests:

To ensure 100% test coverage for the specified lines in `smart_router.py`, we need to add tests to `tests/test_smart_router_full.py`:

1. Add a test to handle a broker that returns an empty dict and logs "Unknown broker veto".
2. Add a test to directly test `_send_alert` to confirm the log is captured.

To achieve 100% test coverage for `backtest.py`, we need to ensure that all branches and edge cases are tested. This includes testing scenarios such as missing API keys, empty data responses, and various strategy outcomes. Additionally, we need to resolve any existing issues with pandas DataFrame usage.

To address the issues with the Pandas DataFrame initialization and the `_log_trade` method, we need to:

1. Replace any `pd.DataFrame(columns=[...])` with `pd.DataFrame(data=[], columns=[...], index=pd.RangeIndex(0))`.
2. In the `_log_trade` method, replace the raw `pd.DataFrame([...], columns=[...])` with `pd.DataFrame.from_records([{...}])`.

Let's implement these changes in the `src/hybrid_ai_trading/pipelines/backtest.py` file.

src/hybrid_ai_trading/pipelines/backtest.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            pd.DataFrame(
                columns=["symbol", "date", "time", "signal",
                         "trade_pnl", "daily_pnl", "cum_equity"]
            ).to_csv(logfile, index=False)
=======
            pd.DataFrame(
                data=[],
                columns=["symbol", "date", "time", "signal",
                         "trade_pnl", "daily_pnl", "cum_equity"],
                index=pd.RangeIndex(0)
            ).to_csv(logfile, index=False)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please let me know if there are specific parts of the `_log_trade` method you would like to modify, or if you have any other specific requirements.

Are you sure you need this SEARCH/REPLACE block?
The REPLACE lines are already in src\hybrid_ai_trading\pipelines\backtest.py!

The SEARCH section must exactly match an existing block of lines including all white space, comments, indentation, docstrings, etc  

It seems the change for initializing the DataFrame with `data=[]` and `index=pd.RangeIndex(0)` is already present in the file. Let's focus on the `_log_trade` method to ensure it uses `pd.DataFrame.from_records([{...}])` for safer record-based writing.

Please confirm if you want me to proceed with this specific change or if there are other areas you want to address.

To address the issue with the DataFrame initialization and ensure all DataFrame initializations in the file use safe patterns, we will:

1. Modify the DataFrame initialization in the `run()` method to use `pd.DataFrame(columns=[...])` without passing an empty list as `data`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

src/hybrid_ai_trading/pipelines/backtest.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            pd.DataFrame(
                data=[],
                columns=["symbol", "date", "time", "signal",
                         "trade_pnl", "daily_pnl", "cum_equity"],
                index=pd.RangeIndex(0)
            ).to_csv(logfile, index=False)
=======
            pd.DataFrame(
                columns=["symbol", "date", "time", "signal",
                         "trade_pnl", "daily_pnl", "cum_equity"]
            ).to_csv(logfile, index=False)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the DataFrame is initialized with only the column names, avoiding the numpy conversion error. If there are other DataFrame initializations in the file, they should also follow this pattern. If you encounter any, let me know, and I can help adjust them as well.
