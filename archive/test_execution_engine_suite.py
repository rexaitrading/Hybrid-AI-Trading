ExecutionEngine Test Suite (Hybrid AI Quant Pro v1.0 â€“ Hedge Fund Grade)
========================================================================
Unified test runner that ensures:
- Both ExecutionEngine main functionality (dry_run, live, portfolio, risk)
- ExecutionEngine LLVM stub safety (alias + stub methods)

This guarantees:
- 100% coverage across ExecutionEngine and legacy compatibility stubs
- Hedge-fund grade confidence: no silent JIT fallbacks
