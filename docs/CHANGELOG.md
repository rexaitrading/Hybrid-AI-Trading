## 2025-11-07  Phase 6 & 7: IBG Tools + Pre-Market Hardening

- Eliminated PS5.1 binder collisions by adding paramless fixed-port IBG status helpers.
- Robust heartbeats for PAPER/LIVE with race-free kernel listen probes.
- Slack posting remains best-effort & ID-safe.
- Scheduler @ 06:55 PT standardized; wrapper uses binder-proof flow.
- All files UTF-8 no-BOM; \C:\IBC\IBGTools.psm1\ is the single source of truth.
## 2025-11-05
- Risk layer: 153 tests green (non-IB subset)
- Backtest subset: green
- Added safety/observability logs
